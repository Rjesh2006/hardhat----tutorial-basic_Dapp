**So first we have to understand that what is hardhat is: :🙇‍♂️**

# Hardhat: Ethereum Development Environment

Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment designed for professionals. It streamlines the process of creating, testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Here are its key features:

## Features:

1. **Flexible and Extensible**:
   - **Hardhat Runner**: Automates tasks like running tests and interacting with smart contracts.
   - **Local Solidity Execution**: Test and debug locally without live environments.
   - **Debugging-First Approach**: Provides Solidity stack traces, console logs, and explicit error messages for better debugging.
   - **Extreme Flexibility**: Customize tasks or even entire workflows to fit your project's needs.

2. **Bring Your Own Tools**:
   - Hardhat integrates seamlessly with your existing tools.
   - **Fully Extensible**: Address project-specific needs by extending Hardhat's functionality.
   - **Plugin Ecosystem**: Leverage a composable ecosystem of plugins.

3. **Fast Iteration**:
   - Speed up your development feedback loop by making it up to 10x faster with Hardhat.
   - **TypeScript Support**: Catch mistakes before running your code using TypeScript natively.

4. **Vibrant Community**:
   - Join the Hardhat community to find answers, collaborate, and contribute to the plugin ecosystem.
   - Trusted by top teams like Decentraland and Kyber.

*now we ccan move for our moto to create a dapp by using hardhat:-*
**installation**
 - *on ubuntu*

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```


**step 2 :now creat a main directory where we have to work on :name as(hardhat-turorial)**

```
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
```

*Use the tabs in the snippets to select your preferred package manager. We recommend using npm 7 or later, since it makes installing Hardhat's dependencies much easier.*

```
npm init
```

*Now we can install Hardhat:*

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

*In the same directory where you installed Hardhat hit the given command there*
```
npx hardhat init
```

**then you will be able to see the interface like this :-🕶️**

fig of hardhat:-


- *Hardhat Configuration*

* **Location**: The `hardhat.config.js` file is located at the root of your project.
* **Initialization**: Even an empty `hardhat.config.js` file is sufficient for Hardhat to function.
* **Setup**: All configuration details for Hardhat are contained within this single file.
```
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```
*add this line in ur hardhat config.js file*
- *it will look like this:*
- fig
  

***step :3***
*weriting smart contracts by ctrating a contacts directory where we will put our smart contracts file(.sol )file:*
*i created here Token.sol file in contracts directory you can creat .sol file by any anyname*

*now you can click here to get that smart contracts to put in Token.sol*

link6464646464646

*then comppile that sol fle by hardhat :-*
```
$ npx hardhat compile
```
*then you will see like this interface:-*
figure664646

***step 4***
*Testing  contraact's*
 *now creart a test directory the put token.js file in that directory   (get the js code to click on the given link below:-::::::↙️):*
  - link54452646446444639

*then coompile that test direcrory : by the given command:-**
```
$ npx hardhat test
```
*interface you will be see*
fig545555

*and if u want to understand the code expalnation then click here:*

link 64464646464646



***step:4***
*Deploying to a live network:*
 *creat a directory name as (ignition) then dive into the ignition directory then creat a another direcrtory inside that directory name as (modules) then also dive in module directory now creat a file name as Token.js isnide the modules diretory: :😰*

*put the given code in Token.js file by cickk on this given link:-⬇️*

links4446464466
*then follow the commands:*
```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.js --network <network-name>
```

*NOTE:<ins>With our current configuration, running it without the --network parameter would cause the code to run against an embedded instance of Hardhat Network. In this scenario, the deployment actually gets lost when Hardhat finishes running, but it's still useful to test that our deployment code works:<ins>*

*interface will be like this:*
fig6464646464


***step 4:***
*Deploying to remote networks*

 *now open ur hardhat congig.js file and remove all the previous code from there and put this give code by clicking on the given link :🔄*

 link 446464646

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.js --network sepolia

````
*innterface will be lookk like this:-*

*now run the give command*
```
$ npx hardhat vars setup
```

fig

**
```
$ npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY <your-infura-api-key>
$ npx hardhat vars set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY <your-sepolia-private-key>
```

*Finally, deploy to the Sepolia network using the following command*
*note: if you want to deploy this on test net then chnge networrk for maiinet to ----> testnet network*
```
$ npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.js --network sepolia
? Confirm deploy to network sepolia (11155111)? » (y/N) <y>
```
*interface will be*
figure444646464


*and afer this you will get a (TokenModule#Token) then put that on the givenn link  to see ur Dapp:*
[blockchainexplorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)

**if you followed all the previous commmandss ccorrecctly then you will be able to see the final interface:liike this 🥇**
